# ED-UGR
Repository for the subject Data Structures (Estructuras de Datos) in the Computer Engineering's Degree at the UGR

- Contains:
  - Exercises of queues, stacks, maps, vectors and other containers of the STL. Theory exercises.
  - Practices:
    - **P2** (practice 1 was an example): implementation of an ""Image"" class for the representation of images. Creation of functions for zoom, morphing, reduction etc.
    - **P3**: use of data structures to create the TDA Stack_Max (stack with a maximum). A list and a dynamic vector will be used.
    - **P4**: use of list-type structures to create a dictionary TDA and use of map-type structures to create a telephone directory TDA.
    - **P5**: implementation of a software to help an airline to visualize its routes (for
which countries does it go through). Specifically, the airline will want to display routes with a specific code on a world map. To do this, the TDA point, route, route store and the necessary operators are specified.
